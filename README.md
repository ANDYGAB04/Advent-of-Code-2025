# Advent of Code 2025

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2025** repository! 🎄✨  
This project contains my solutions to the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), a series of daily programming challenges that run each December.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event created by Eric Wastl. Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new festive challenge is released, designed to test your problem-solving and coding skills.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge solution is organized by day number:

```
/
├── day01/
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── solution.py
├── day02/
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── solution.py
...
```
- `input.txt` — The puzzle input for the day.
- `solution.py` — My solution for the day's puzzle.

## Running the Solutions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANDYGAB04/Advent-of-Code-2025.git
   ```

2. Change to the desired day's directory and run the solution script:

   ```bash
   cd Advent-of-Code-2025/day01
   python solution.py
   ```

   _(Make sure you have Python installed.)_

## Progress

| Day  | Part 1 | Part 2 |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1    | ✅     | ✅     |
| 2    | ✅     |        |
| ...  |        |        |

> Check back each day in December for new solutions!
